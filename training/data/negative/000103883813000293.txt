a)


The correctness of operation of the Metering System will be supervised by the Purchaser’s relevant services.











  


b)


With respect to requirements and procedures concerning the measurement technique and operation and inspection of the Metering System that have not been agreed in this Appendix, the Parties shall comply with the relevant provisions of the PGNiG S.A. Company Standards, series ZN-G-4001÷4010:2001.











  


c)


The Parties shall adopt a time schedule of inspection of the Metering System by the end of January of a Contract Year.
