The Warrant may be exercised (the “Exercise Period”) commencing on the date set forth above as the Issue Date (the “Issue Date”) set forth above and ending on the date set forth above as the Expiration Date (the “Expiration Date”).4.Method of Exercise. This Warrant may be exercised in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time during the Exercise Period, by surrender of this Warrant and delivery of a completed Exercise Form attached hereto as Schedule A, duly executed and directed to the Company at its principal place of business, accompanied by certified funds payable to the Company in the amount of the appropriate Exercise Price.  Upon receipt of the Exercise Form and the Exercise Price, the Company shall make prompt delivery or cause to be delivered (in any event within three (3) Business Days (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) of receipt of the Exercise Form and Exercise Price) of a certificate evidencing the number of whole Warrant Shares to which the Holder may be entitled, and pay to the Holder, in lieu of issuing any fractional Share, cash in an amount equal to the amount of any fraction associated with any such fractional Share multiplied by the then effective Exercise Price.  In case of the purchase of less than all the Warrant Shares purchasable under this Warrant, the Company shall cancel this Warrant upon surrender hereof and shall execute and deliver a new Warrant of like tenor and date for the balance of the Warrant Shares purchasable hereunder.5.Rights as Stockholder. The Holder shall have no rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to any Warrant Shares prior to the exercise of this Warrant, and then only with respect to those shares of Common Stock actually acquired upon such due and proper exercise.6.Adjustment of Exercise Price and Number of Warrant Shares. The Exercise Price and the number of Warrant Shares (or amount of other securities or property) shall be subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of certain events described in this Section 6.(a)Subdivision or Combination of Stock. If, with respect to the Common Stock, the Company shall effect a stock dividend or stock split or subdivide its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such stock dividend, stock split or subdivision shall be proportionately reduced, and conversely, if the Company shall effect a reverse stock split or combine its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such reverse stock split or combination shall be proportionately increased.  Upon each adjustment of the Exercise Price, the Holder of this Warrant shall thereafter be entitled to purchase, at the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment, the number of shares obtained by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by the number of shares purchasable pursuant hereto immediately prior to such adjustment, and dividing the product thereof by the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment.(b)Reorganization, Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale. If any reclassification, recapitalization or reorganization, or consolidation or merger of the Company with another corporation, or the sale of all or substantially all of its assets or other similar transaction, shall be effected in such a way that holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive, with respect to or in exchange for their shares of Common Stock, securities or other assets or property (an “Organic Change”) and the Company is the resulting or surviving corporation of such Organic Change, then, as a condition of such Organic Change, provisions shall be made by the Company whereby the Holder hereof shall thereafter have the right to purchase and receive (in lieu of the shares of the Common Stock of the Company purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant immediately prior to such Organic Change) such shares of stock, securities or other assets or property as may be issued or payable in connection with such Organic Change with respect to or in exchange for the number of outstanding shares of such Common Stock purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant immediately prior to such Organic Change.  In the event of any Organic Change, appropriate provision shall be made by the Company with respect to the rights and interests of the Holder of this Warrant to the end that the provisions hereof (including, without limitation, provisions for adjustments of the Exercise Price and of the number of shares (or amount of stock, other securities or property) purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant) shall thereafter be applicable, in relation to any shares of stock, securities or property thereafter deliverable upon the exercise hereof.  In the event of any Organic Change pursuant to which the Company is not the surviving or resulting corporation, prior to the consummation thereof, the corporation resulting from such Organic Change or the corporation purchasing such assets shall assume by written instrument the obligation to deliver to the Holder such shares of stock, securities or assets as, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the Holder may be entitled to purchase.(c)No Impairment.  The Company shall not, by amendment of its articles or certificate of incorporation or through a reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue, or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed under this Warrant by the Company, but shall at all times assist in carrying out all of the provisions of this Warrant and in taking all such action as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to protect the Holder's rights hereunder against impairment.  If the Company takes any action affecting its Common Stock other than as described above that adversely affects the Holder's rights under this Warrant, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted downward and the number of Warrant Shares shall be adjusted upward in such a manner that the aggregate Exercise Price of this Warrant is unchanged.(d)Notices of Change.(i)Promptly upon any adjustment in the number or class of shares subject to this Warrant and of the Exercise Price, the Company shall give written notice thereof to the Holder, and furnish the Holder with a certificate from its Chief Financial Officer setting forth in reasonable detail such adjustment and the facts upon which such adjustment is based. The Company shall, upon written request, furnish the Holder a certificate setting forth the Exercise Price in effect upon the date thereof and the series of adjustments leading to such Exercise Price.(ii)The Company shall give written notice to the Holder at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the date on which the Company closes its books or takes a record for determining rights of the holders of its Common Stock to receive any dividends or distributions (whether payable in cash, securities or other property).(iii)The Company shall also give written notice to the Holder at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the date on which an Organic Change shall take place.(iv)The Company shall give written notice to the Holder at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the effective date of any proposed liquidation, or dissolution or winding up of the Company.(e)Calculations. All calculations under this Section 6 shall be made to the nearest 1/10th of a cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as applicable. The number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any given time shall not include shares owned or held by or for the account of the Company, and the disposition of any such shares shall be considered an issue or sale of Common Stock.(f)Adjustments. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 6, no adjustment of the Exercise Price shall be required if such adjustment is less than $0.01; provided, however, that any adjustments that by reason of this Section 6(h) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account for purposes of any subsequent adjustment.7.     Investment Representations.(a)The Holder represents and warrants to the Company that the Holder is acquiring the Warrant and the Warrant Shares for the Holder's own account for the purpose of investment and not with a view toward resale or other distribution thereof in violation of the Act.
