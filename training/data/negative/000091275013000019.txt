AWARD OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

 

The Compensation & Management Development Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of Newfield Exploration Company, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), pursuant to the Newfield Exploration Company 2011 Omnibus Stock Plan (the “Plan”), hereby awards to you, the above-named awardee, effective as of the Date of Award set forth above (the “Date of Award”), that number of restricted stock units set forth above (the “Restricted Stock Units”), on the following terms and conditions:

 

The Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to the prohibitions and restrictions set forth herein with respect to the sale or other disposition of such Restricted Stock Units and the obligation to forfeit and surrender such Restricted Stock Units to the Company (the “Forfeiture Restrictions”).  The Forfeiture Restrictions shall lapse at the time and in the manner described in the attached Terms and Conditions (the “Terms and Conditions”).

 

Upon the lapse of the Forfeiture Restrictions with respect to a Restricted Stock Unit, the Company shall issue to you one share of the Company’s Common Stock, $.01 par value per share (the “Common Stock”), in exchange for such Restricted Stock Unit and thereafter you shall have no further rights with respect to such Restricted Stock Unit and such share of the Common Stock shall be transferable by you (except to the extent that any proposed transfer would, in the opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company, constitute a violation of applicable federal or state securities law).

 

If during the period in which you hold the Restricted Stock Units the Company pays a dividend in shares of the Common Stock with respect to the outstanding shares of the Common Stock, then the Company will increase the Restricted Stock Units that have not then been exchanged by the Company for shares of the Common Stock by an amount equal to the product of (a) the Restricted Stock Units that have not been forfeited to the Company or exchanged by the Company for shares of the Common Stock and (b) the number of shares of the Common Stock paid by the Company per share of the Common Stock (collectively, the “Stock Dividend Restricted Stock Units”).  Each Stock Dividend Restricted Stock Unit will be subject to same Forfeiture Restrictions and other restrictions, limitations and conditions applicable to the Restricted Stock Unit for which such Stock Dividend Restricted Stock Unit was awarded and will be exchanged for shares of the Common Stock at the same time and on the same basis as such Restricted Stock Unit.

 



  



  

 



  



 

Notwithstanding any provisions of the Plan, shares of Common Stock shall be transferred at the time(s) specified in this Agreement and the Terms and Conditions.

 

The Restricted Stock Units may not be sold, assigned, pledged, exchanged, hypothecated or otherwise transferred, encumbered or disposed of (other than by will or the applicable laws of descent and distribution).  Any such attempted sale, assignment, pledge, exchange, hypothecation, transfer, encumbrance or disposition in violation of this Agreement shall be void and the Company shall not be bound thereby.  Any shares of Common Stock issued to you in exchange for the Restricted Stock Units may not be sold or otherwise disposed of in any manner that would constitute a violation of any applicable federal or state securities laws.  You also agree that (a) the Company may refuse to cause the transfer of any such shares of the Common Stock to be registered on the stock register of the Company if such proposed transfer would in the opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company constitute a violation of any applicable federal or state securities law and (b) the Company may give related instructions to the transfer agent, if any, to stop registration of the transfer of such shares of the Common Stock.

 

The shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the Plan are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under a Registration Statement on Form S-8.

 

Capitalized terms that are not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Plan or the Terms and Conditions.

 

In accepting the award of the Restricted Stock Units you accept and agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions of the Plan, this Agreement and the Terms and Conditions.
