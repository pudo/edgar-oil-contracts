Such notice shall be in writing and set forth all of Buyer’s disagreements with respect to any portion of the Final Adjustment Statement, together with Buyer’s proposed changes thereto, and shall include an explanation in reasonable detail of, and such supporting documentation as is reasonably necessary to support, such changes.  If Buyer has timely delivered such a notice of disagreement to Seller,      - 5 -then, upon written agreement between Buyer and Seller resolving all disagreements of Buyer set forth in such notice, the Final Adjustment Statement will become final and binding upon Buyer and Seller as to the Net Cash Flow.

Buyer agrees to maintain all information made available to it pursuant to Section 5.1 confidential and to cause its officers, employees, representatives, consultants and advisors to maintain all information made available to them pursuant to Section 5.1 confidential, all as provided in that certain Confidentiality Agreement dated September 14, 2013 (the “Confidentiality Agreement”), by and between Seller and Buyer, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this Agreement.ARTICLE VI     TITLE ADJUSTMENTS6.1    No Warranty or Representation.  Without limiting Buyer’s right to adjust the Purchase Price by operation of Section 6.2 and Section 6.5 and except for the special warranty of title which is contained in the Conveyance, Seller makes no warranty or representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to Seller’s title to any of the Assets and Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except as provided above, Buyer’s sole remedy for any defect of title, including any Title Defect, with respect to any of the Assets shall be pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Article VI, which remedies (other than those provided for in Section 6.5) shall cease, and be deemed to be finally and conclusively satisfied, in all respects, upon the Closing.  Furthermore, Seller makes no warranty or representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the accuracy or completeness of the information, records and data now, heretofore or hereafter made available to Buyer in connection with this Agreement (including, without limitation, any description of the Assets, pricing assumptions, potential for production of oil, gas or other hydrocarbons from the Subject Interests or any other matters contained in or related to the Reserve Report or any other material furnished to Buyer by Seller or by Seller’s agents or representatives).6.2    Buyer’s Title Review.(a)    Buyer’s Assertion of Title Defects.  During the period commencing on the execution of this Agreement and terminating on December 6, 2013 (the “Title Examination Period”), Buyer      - 11 -shall notify Seller in writing of any matters which, in Buyer’s reasonable opinion, constitute Title Defects and which Buyer intends to assert as a Title Defect with respect to any portion of a Property Subdivision pursuant to this Article VI.  For all purposes of this Agreement, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived any Title Defect which Buyer fails to assert as a Title Defect by written notice given to Seller on or before the expiration of the Title Examination Period.  To be effective, Buyer’s written notice of a Title Defect must include (i) a brief description of the matter constituting the asserted Title Defect, (ii) the claimed Title Defect Amount attributable thereto, and (iii) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by Seller) to verify the existence of such asserted Title Defect.  To give Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Title Defects, Buyer agrees to give Seller written notice of any Title Defect which Buyer determines exists promptly following Buyer’s determination of the existence of same, which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the end of the Title Examination Period.  Buyer shall also promptly furnish Seller with written notice of any Seller Title Credit which is discovered by any of Buyer’s employees or representatives while conducting Buyer’s title review, due diligence or investigation with respect to the Subject Interests and Property Subdivisions.(b)    Purchase Price Allocations.  A portion of the Purchase Price has been allocated by Buyer to the various Subject Interests in Property Subdivisions in the manner and in accordance with the respective values set forth in Part II of the Property Schedule.  If any adjustment is made to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 6.2, a corresponding adjustment shall be made to the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to the affected Property Subdivision in Part II of the Property Schedule.(c)    Seller’s Opportunity to Cure.  Seller shall have ten (10) days after the expiration of the Title Examination Period, at its cost and expense, if it so elects but without obligation, to cure all or a portion of such asserted Title Defects at Seller’s sole cost and expense.  Any asserted Title Defects which are waived by Buyer or cured within such time shall be deemed “Permitted Encumbrances” hereunder.  If Seller within such time fails to cure any Title Defect of which Buyer has given timely written notice as required above and Buyer has not and does not waive same on or before the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Property Subdivision affected by such uncured and unwaived Title Defect shall be a “Title Defect Property”.(d)    Buyer’s Title Adjustments.  Subject to Sections 6.5 and 6.6, as Buyer’s sole and exclusive remedy with respect to Title Defects, Buyer shall be entitled to reduce the Purchase Price by the amount, if any, by which the aggregate amount of Title Defect Amounts with respect to all Title Defect Properties exceeds an amount equal to two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the Purchase Price (the “Title Defect Deductible”) plus the aggregate amount of Seller Title Credits with respect to all Property Subdivisions.  As used herein, the term “Title Defect Amount” shall mean, with respect to a Title Defect Property, the amount by which the value of such Title Defect Property is impaired as a result of the existence of one or more uncured and unwaived Title Defects, which amount shall be determined as follows:(1)    If the Title Defect results from Seller having a lesser Net Revenue Interest in such Title Defect Property than the Net Revenue Interest specified therefor in Part II(A) of the Property Schedule, the Title Defect Amount shall be equal to the product obtained by      - 12 -multiplying the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such Title Defect Property in Part II(A) of the Property Schedule by a fraction, the numerator of which is the reduction in the Net Revenue Interest and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest specified for such Title Defect Property in Part II(A) of the Property Schedule.(2)    If the Title Defect results from Seller having a greater Working Interest in a Title Defect Property set forth in Part II(A) of the Property Schedule than the Working Interest specified therefor in Part II(A) of the Property Schedule, the Title Defect Amount shall be equal to the present value (discounted at 10% compounded annually) of the increase in the costs and expenses forecasted in the Reserve Report with respect to such Title Defect Property for the period from and after the Effective Time which is attributable to such increase in Seller’s Working Interest; provided, however, that no Title Defect Amount shall be allowed on account of and to the extent that an increase in Seller’s Working Interest in such a Property Subdivision has the effect of proportionately increasing Seller’s Net Revenue Interest therein.(3)    If the Title Defect results from Seller having fewer number of Net Acres in a Title Defect Property set forth in Part II(B) of the Property Schedule than the number of Net Acres specified therefor in Part II(B) of the Property Schedule, the Title Defect Amount shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such Title Defect Property in Part II(B) of the Property Schedule by a fraction, the numerator of which is the reduction in the Net Acres and the denominator of which is the number of Net Acres specified for such Title Defect Property in Part II(B) of the Property Schedule.(4)    If the Title Defect results from the existence of a lien, the Title Defect Amount shall be an amount sufficient to discharge such lien.(5)    If the Title Defect results from any matter not described in paragraphs (1), (2), (3) or (4) above, the Title Defect Amount shall be an amount equal to the difference between the value of the Title Defect Property affected by such Title Defect with such Title Defect and the value of such Title Defect Property without such Title Defect (taking into account the portion of the Purchase Price allocated in Part II of the Property Schedule to such Title Defect Property); provided, however, if such Title Defect is reasonably susceptible of being cured, the Title Defect Amount shall not be greater than the reasonable cost and expense of curing such Title Defect.(6)    If a Title Defect is not effective or does not affect a Title Defect Property throughout the entire productive life of such Title Defect Property, such fact shall be taken into account in determining the Title Defect Amount.(7)    The Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another Title Defect Amount hereunder.  For example, but without limitation, if a lien affects more than one Title Defect Property or the curative work with respect to one Title Defect results (or is reasonably expected to result) in the curing of any other Title Defect affecting the same or another Title      - 13 -Defect Property, the amount necessary to discharge such lien or the cost and expense of such curative work shall only be included in the Title Defect Amount for one Title Defect Property and only once in such Title Defect Amount.(8)    If a Title Defect affects only a portion of a Property Subdivision (as contrasted with an undivided interest in the entirety of such Property Subdivision) and a portion of the Purchase Price has not been allocated specifically to such portion of a Property Subdivision in the Property Schedule, then for purposes of computing the Title Defect Amount, the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such Property Subdivision shall be further allocated among the portions of such Property Subdivision in the proportion that the net acreage (or net acre feet, as appropriate) of such Property Subdivision affected by such Title Defect bears to the net acreage (or net acre feet, as appropriate) in the entire Property Subdivision.  In the event such Property Subdivision is subject to a unitization agreement, the foregoing allocation shall be made in a manner which is consistent with the allocation of production or productive acreage in such unitization agreement.(9)    The Title Defect Amount attributable to a Title Defect Property or any portion thereof shall not exceed the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such Title Defect Property or such portion thereof calculated in accordance with paragraph (8) above.  For example, but without limitation, if Seller does not own fifty percent (50%) of the Net Revenue Interest specified in the Property Schedule for a Title Defect Property and such unowned fifty percent (50%) interest is also burdened by a lien, the Title Defect Amount for such Title Defect Property shall not exceed the portion of the Purchase Price allocable to such fifty percent (50%) interest notwithstanding that it may be affected by multiple Title Defects.(10)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Title Defect Amount determined pursuant to the foregoing with respect to a Title Defect Property is $20,000 or less (or, with respect to a Title Defect affecting a Property Subdivision described in Part II(B) of the Property Schedule, $20,000 or less per oil and gas lease affected thereby), then the Title Defect Amount with respect to such Title Defect Property (or, with respect to a Title Defect affecting a Property Subdivision described in Part II(B) of the Property Schedule, the Title Defect Amount with respect to such oil and gas lease) shall be deemed to be zero.The Title Defect Deductible shall be restored to the extent that any portion thereof is applied as a credit against a Title Defect Amount attributable to a Title Defect which is subsequently cured by Seller or determined not to constitute a Title Defect.6.3    Determination of Title Defects.  A portion of a Property Subdivision shall be deemed to have a “Title Defect” if Seller does not have Defensible Title thereto as of the Effective Time and as of the Closing Date.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the following matters shall be deemed to be Permitted Encumbrances and shall not be asserted as, and shall not constitute Title Defects:  (a) defects in the early chain of the title consisting of the mere failure to recite marital status in a document or omissions of successions of heirship proceedings, unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that such failure or omission results in another Person’s superior claim of title to the relevant Property Subdivision or portion thereof, (b) defects arising out of lack of survey, (c) defects arising out of lack of corporate authorization,      - 14 -unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that such corporate action was not authorized and results in another Person’s superior claim of title to the relevant Property Subdivision or portion thereof, (d) defects that have been cured by possession under the applicable statutes of limitations or prescription, (e) defects or irregularities resulting from or related to probate proceedings or the lack thereof, which defects or irregularities have been outstanding for four (4) years or more, (f) defects based solely on the existence of prior oil and gas leases relating to the Subject Interests that are expired and no longer in force and legal effect but not surrendered of record, (g) defects arising from a mortgage encumbering the oil, gas or mineral estate of any lessor (unless a complaint of foreclosure has been filed or any similar action taken by the mortgagee thereunder and in such case such mortgage has not been subordinated to the Subject Interests affected thereby), (h) defects based solely on lack of information in Seller’s files or references to documents if such documents are not in Seller’s files, and (i) defects in the chain of title prior to January 1, 1950, unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that the defect results in another Person’s superior claim of title to the relevant Property Subdivision or portion thereof.6.4    Seller Title Credit.  A “Seller Title Credit” shall mean, with respect to a Property Subdivision, the amount by which the value of such Property Subdivision is enhanced by virtue of (a) Seller having a greater Net Revenue Interest in such Property Subdivision than the Net Revenue Interest specified therefor in Part II(A) of the Property Schedule, (b) with respect to each Property Subdivision described in Part II(A) of the Property Schedule, Seller having a lesser Working Interest in such Property Subdivision than the Working Interest specified therefor in Part II(A) of the Property Schedule without a corresponding reduction in Net Revenue Interest with respect to such Property Subdivision specified therefor in Part II(A) of the Property Schedule or (c) with respect to each Property Subdivision described in Part II(B) of the Property Schedule, Seller having a greater number of Net Acres than the number of Net Acres specified therefor in Part II(B) of the Property Schedule.  The amount of Seller Title Credits shall be determined as follows:(1)    If the Seller Title Credit results from Seller having a greater Net Revenue Interest in such Property Subdivision than the Net Revenue Interest specified therefor in Part II(A) of the Property Schedule, the Seller Title Credit shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such Property Subdivision in Part II(A) of the Property Schedule by a fraction, the numerator of which is the increase in the Net Revenue Interest and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest specified for such Property Subdivision in Part II(A) of the Property Schedule.(2)    If the Seller Title Credit results from Seller having a lesser Working Interest in a Property Subdivision than the Working Interest specified therefor in Part II(A) of the Property Schedule without a corresponding reduction in Net Revenue Interest with respect to such Property Subdivision specified therefor in Part II(A) of the Property Schedule, the Seller Title Credit shall be equal to the present value (discounted at 10% compounded annually) of the decrease in the costs and expenses forecasted in the Reserve Report with respect to such Property Subdivision for the period from and after the Effective Time which is attributable to such decrease in Seller's Working Interest; provided, however, no Seller Title Credit shall be allowed on account of and to the extent that a decrease in Seller’s      - 15 -Working Interest in such a Property Subdivision has the effect of proportionately decreasing Seller’s Net Revenue Interest therein.(3)    If the Title Defect results from Buyer having greater number of Net Acres in a Property Subdivision than the number of Net Acres specified therefor in Part II(B) of the Property Schedule, the Seller Title Credit shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such Property Subdivision in Part II(B) of the Property Schedule by a fraction, the numerator of which is the increase in the Net Acres and the denominator of which is the number of Net Acres specified for such Property Subdivision in Part II(B) of the Property Schedule.(4)    In determining the amount of Seller Title Credits, the principles and methodology set forth in paragraphs (6), (7), (8) and (10) of Section 6.2(d) shall be applied, mutatis mutandis.6.5    Exclusion of Title Defect Properties.  On or before the Closing Date, Seller may with respect to any Title Defect Property elect to retain and exclude such Title Defect Property from the Assets to be conveyed by Seller to Buyer pursuant to the terms hereof so long as the Purchase Price is reduced by the portion of the Purchase Price allocated (or deemed allocated pursuant to Section 6.2(d)(8)) to such Title Defect Property in Part II of the Property Schedule.  In the event Seller exercises its right under this Section 6.5 with respect to a Title Defect Property, said Title Defect Property, together with a pro rata share of all incidental rights, oil, gas and other hydrocarbons and other assets attributable or appurtenant thereto, shall be retained by Seller and excluded from the Assets which are conveyed by Seller to Buyer pursuant to the Conveyance.  6.6    Deferred Claims and Disputes.  In the event that Buyer and Seller have not agreed upon one or more adjustments, credits or offsets claimed by Buyer or Seller pursuant to and in accordance with the requirements of this Article VI, any such claim (a “Deferred Adjustment Claim”) shall be settled pursuant to this Section 6.6 and, except as provided in Sections 9.1(e) and 9.2(e), shall not prevent or delay Closing.  With respect to each potential Deferred Adjustment Claim, Buyer and Seller shall deliver to the other a written notice describing each such potential Deferred Adjustment Claim, the amount in dispute and a statement setting forth the facts and circumstances that support such Party’s position with respect to such Deferred Adjustment Claim.  At Closing, the Purchase Price shall not be adjusted on account of, and, except as provided in Sections 9.1(e) and 9.2(e), no effect shall be given to, the Deferred Adjustment Claim.  On or prior to the thirtieth (30th) consecutive calendar day following the Closing Date (the “Deferred Matters Date”), Seller and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to reach agreement on the Deferred Adjustment Claims and, ultimately, to resolve by written agreement all disputes regarding the Deferred Adjustment Claims.  Any Deferred Adjustment Claims which are not so resolved on or before the Deferred Matters Date shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Procedures; provided, however, that Seller may elect at any time to resolve all disputes relating to the Deferred Adjustment Claims by the payment to Buyer of the amount by which the Purchase Price would have been reduced at Closing on account of the Title Defects which constitute Deferred Adjustment Claims if same did not constitute Deferred Adjustment Claims.  Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the contrary, including Section 6.2(c), Seller shall be      - 16 -entitled to cure any Title Defect which constitutes a Deferred Adjustment Claim at any time prior to the point in time when a final and binding written decision of the board of arbitrators is made with respect thereto in accordance with the Arbitration Procedures.  The amount of any reduction in the Purchase Price to which Buyer becomes entitled under the final and binding written decision of the board of arbitrators shall be promptly refunded by Seller to Buyer together with interest thereon from the Closing Date until paid at the Agreed Rate.6.7    No Duplication.  Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the contrary, if a Title Defect results from any matter which could also result in the breach of any representation or warranty of Seller set forth in Section 4.1, then Buyer shall only be entitled to assert such matter as a Title Defect pursuant to this Article VI and shall be precluded from also asserting such matter as the basis of the breach of any such representation or warranty.ARTICLE VII     PREFERENCE RIGHTS AND TRANSFER REQUIREMENTS7.1    Compliance.  Buyer’s purchase of the Assets is expressly subject to all validly existing and applicable Preference Rights and Transfer Requirements.  To Seller’s knowledge, all agreements containing a (i) Preference Right are set forth in Part I of Schedule 7.1 and (ii) Transfer Requirement are set forth in Part II of Schedule 7.1.  Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall initiate all procedures required to comply with or obtain the waiver of all Preference Rights and Transfer Requirements set forth on Schedule 7.1 with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  Seller shall not be obligated to pay any consideration to (or incur any cost or expense for the benefit of) the holder of any Preference Right or Transfer Requirement in order to obtain the waiver thereof or compliance therewith.7.2    Effect of Preference Rights.  If a third party who has been offered a Preference Property pursuant to Section 7.1 elects prior to Closing to purchase such Preference Property in accordance with the terms of such Preference Right, and Seller receives written notice of such election prior to the Closing Date, such Preference Property will be eliminated from the Assets and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such Preference Property pursuant to the immediately following sentence.  The portion of the Purchase Price to be allocated to any Asset or portion thereof affected by a Preference Right (a “Preference Property”) shall be the portion of the Purchase Price allocated thereto in Part II of the Property Schedule.  If a Preference Right affects only a portion of a Property Subdivision and a portion of the Purchase Price has not been allocated specifically to such portion of a Property Subdivision in Part II of the Property Schedule, then the portion of the Purchase Price to be allocated to such Preference Property shall be determined in the same manner as provided in Section 6.2(d)(8) when a Title Defect affects only a portion of a Property Subdivision.  If a third party who has been offered a Preference Property or who has been requested to waive its Preference Right pursuant to Section 7.1 does not elect to purchase such Preference Property or waive such Preference Right with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to the Closing Date, such Preference Property shall be conveyed to Buyer at Closing subject to such Preference Right, unless such Preference Property has been otherwise eliminated from the Assets in accordance with other provisions of this Agreement.  If a third party elects to purchase a Preference Property subject to a Preference Right      - 17 -and Closing has already occurred with respect to such Preference Property, Buyer shall be obligated to convey said Preference Property to such third party and shall be entitled to the consideration for the sale of such Preference Property.7.3    Transfer Requirements.  If a Transfer Requirement is applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the failure to satisfy such Transfer Requirement would, by its express terms and applicable Law, render the assignment of an Asset void or result in termination thereof, is not obtained, complied with or otherwise satisfied prior to the Closing Date, then, unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by Seller and Buyer, (i) any Asset or portion thereof affected by such Transfer Requirement (a “Retained Asset”) shall be held back from the Assets to be transferred and conveyed to Buyer at Closing and the Purchase Price to be paid at Closing shall be reduced by the portion of the Purchase Price which would be allocated to such Retained Asset pursuant to Section 7.2 if such Retained Asset were a Preference Property.  Any Retained Asset so held back at the Closing will be conveyed to Buyer within ten (10) days following the date on which Seller obtains, complies with or otherwise satisfies all Transfer Requirements with respect to such Retained Asset for a purchase price equal to the amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced on account of the holding back of such Retained Asset, as adjusted pursuant to Section 3.4; provided, however, if all Transfer Requirements with respect to any Retained Asset so held back at the Closing are not obtained, complied with or otherwise satisfied within one hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing Date, then such Retained Asset shall be eliminated from the Assets and this Agreement unless Seller and Buyer mutually agree to proceed with a closing on such Retained Asset in which case Buyer shall be deemed to have waived any objection with respect to non-compliance with such Transfer Requirements.7.4    Certain Governmental Consents.  Seller and Buyer will each use its respective commercially reasonable efforts after Closing to obtain all approvals and consents from the United States Department of Interior and the applicable state or Indian agencies or authorities that may be required under the terms of (or regulations specifically applicable to) any federal, state or Indian leases in connection with the assignment of the Subject Interests therein from Seller to Buyer.  Until such approvals and consents are obtained, Seller shall continue to hold legal title to such Subject Interests as nominee for Buyer.  Seller shall not be obligated to incur any costs or expenses in Seller’s capacity as nominee.  For purposes of Article XIII, Seller and Buyer shall treat and deal with such Subject Interests as if full legal and equitable title to such Subject Interests had passed from Seller to Buyer at Closing.7.5    Express Conditions on Sale.  Buyer acknowledges that Seller desires to sell all of the Assets and would not have entered into this Agreement but for Buyer’s agreement to purchase all of the Assets as herein provided.  Accordingly, it is expressly understood and agreed that Seller does not desire to sell any Preference Property unless the sale of all or substantially all of the Assets is consummated by the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  In furtherance of the foregoing, Seller’s obligation hereunder to sell the Preference Properties to Buyer is expressly conditioned upon the consummation by the Closing Date of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, either by conveyance to Buyer, exclusion by Seller or conveyance pursuant to an applicable Preference Right; provided that, nothing herein is intended or shall operate to extend or apply any Preference Right to any portion of the Assets which is not otherwise burdened thereby.       - 18 -Time is of the essence with respect to the Parties’ agreement to consummate the sale of the Assets by the Closing Date.ARTICLE VIII     COVENANTS OF SELLER AND BUYER8.1    Conduct of Business Pending Closing. Subject to Section 8.2 and the constraints of applicable operating and other agreements, from the date hereof through the Closing (or the earlier termination of this Agreement), except as disclosed on Schedule 8.1, or as otherwise consented to or approved by Buyer in writing (which consent or approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Seller covenants and agrees that:(a)    Sales.  Seller shall not sell, transfer, assign, convey, farmout, release, abandon or otherwise dispose of any Assets, or enter into any transaction the effect of which would be to cause Seller’s ownership interest in any of the Assets to be altered from Seller’s ownership interest as of the date of this Agreement, other than (i) oil, gas and other hydrocarbons produced, saved and sold in the ordinary course of business, and (ii) personal property or equipment which is replaced with personal property or equipment of comparable or better value and utility in connection with the maintenance and operation of the Assets.(b)    Liens.  Seller shall not grant a lien or security interest on any Assets (other than a Permitted Encumbrance).(c)    Operation of Assets.  Seller shall:(ii)    cause the Assets to be maintained and operated in the ordinary course of business, in accordance with Seller’s past practices, maintain insurance now in force with respect to the Assets, and pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses in connection therewith promptly when due;(iii)    not commit to participate in the drilling of any new well or other new operations on the Assets the cost of which (net to Seller’s interest) is in excess of $250,000 in any single instance, without the advance written consent of Buyer, which consent or non‑consent must be given by Buyer within the lesser of (x) ten (10) days of Buyer’s receipt of the notice from Seller or (y) one-half (½) of the applicable notice period within which Seller is contractually obligated to respond to third parties to avoid a deemed election by Seller regarding such operation, as specified in Seller’s notice to Buyer requesting such consent; provided that, failure by Buyer to respond within the aforesaid applicable period shall constitute Buyer’s consent to Seller’s participation in such well or other operation;(iv)    maintain and keep the Assets in full force and effect, including, without limitation, the timely and proper payment of all delay rentals and the timely and proper exercise of optional renewals or primary term extensions under all of the undeveloped leases included in the Assets for which expiration is scheduled to occur on or before January 31, 2014, except where such failure is due to (i) the failure to pay a delay rental, royalty, shut in royalty or other payment by mistake or oversight (including Seller’s negligence) unless      - 19 -caused by Seller’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, or (ii) the failure to participate in an operation which Buyer does not timely approve; (v)    not elect to go non-consent on any operation on the Assets proposed by a third party, subject to the provisions of Section 8.2(b); (vi)    use Seller’s commercially reasonable efforts to maintain its relationships with suppliers, customers and others having material business relations with Seller with respect to the Assets so that they will be preserved for Buyer on and after the Closing Date;(vi)    subject to the immediately following sentence, not later than November 7, 2013, initiate and diligently continue repair, work or re-work, as applicable, on the John W. Morgan “A” 1 Well located in Section 1, Township 1 North, Range 20 East CM, Beaver County, Oklahoma, to attempt to return such well to production on or before the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.1(c), Seller shall not perform any operation on such well in excess of $50,000 without the advance written consent of Buyer.(d)    Contracts and Agreements.  Seller shall not:(iii)    grant or create any Preference Right or Transfer Requirement with respect to the Assets except in connection with the performance by Seller of an obligation or agreement existing on the date hereof or pursuant to this Agreement;(iv)    enter into any oil, gas or other hydrocarbon sales, supply, exchange, processing or transportation contract with respect to the Assets which is not terminable without penalty or detriment on notice of sixty (60) days or less; or(v)    voluntarily relinquish any Seller’s position as operator with respect to the Assets.(e)    Qualifications on Seller’s Conduct. Seller shall:(iv)    pay all expenses incurred with respect to the Assets owned or operated by it in the usual, regular and ordinary manner consistent with past practice and pay all royalties and other burdens and make distribution of production revenues to the owners entitled thereto in accordance with past practices and applicable Law;(v)    give written notice to Buyer as soon as is practicable of any written notice received or given by Seller with respect to any alleged breach by Seller or other Person of any Material Contract; (vi)    give prompt notice to Buyer of (A) any written notice of any material damage to or destruction of any of the Assets of which Seller has knowledge and (B) any written notice received by Seller of any claim asserting any tort or violation of Law or any investigation, suit, action or litigation by or before a Governmental Authority, that (in each case) relates to the Assets and of which Seller has knowledge;     - 20 -(i)    not enter into any contract that would have been a Material Contract if it had been in effect on the date hereof; and(ii)    not amend, modify or terminate any Material Contract or otherwise waive, release or assign any material rights, claims or benefits of Seller under any Material Contract (except for amendments or modifications to (A) compressor contracts for the purpose of obtaining additional compressors and (B) oil, gas or other hydrocarbon sales contracts for the purpose of selling oil, gas or other hydrocarbons included in the Assets on the terms provided by such existing contracts).8.2    Emergencies; Legal Requirements.  Seller may take (or not take, as the case may be) any of the actions mentioned in Section 8.1 above if reasonably necessary under emergency circumstances (or if required or prohibited (as the case may be) pursuant to Law) and provided Buyer is notified as soon thereafter as practicable.(b)    Non‑Operated Properties.  If Seller is not the operator of a particular portion of the Assets, the obligations of Seller in Section 8.1 above with respect to such portion of the Assets, which have reference to operations or activities which pursuant to existing contracts are carried out or performed by the operator, shall be construed to require only that Seller use commercially reasonable efforts (without being obligated to incur any expense or institute any cause of action) to cause the operator of such portion of the Assets to take such actions or render such performance within the constraints of the applicable operating agreements and other applicable agreements.(c)    Certain Operations.  Should Seller not wish to pay any lease rental or other payment or participate in any reworking, deepening, drilling, completion, equipping or other operation on or with respect to any well or other Property Subdivision which may otherwise be required by Section 8.1 above, Seller shall give Buyer written notice thereof at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date such rental or other payment is due or, in the case of an operation, promptly after Seller receives notice of such proposed operation from the operator of such property (or if Seller is the operator, at the same time Seller gives or is required to give notice of such proposed operation to the non‑operators of such property); and Seller shall not be obligated to make any such payment or to elect to participate in any such operation which Seller does not wish to make or participate in unless Seller receives from Buyer, within a reasonable time prior to the date when such payment or election is required to be made by Seller, the written election and agreement of Buyer (i) to require Seller to take such action and (ii) to pay all costs and expenses of Seller with respect to such lease rental or other payment or such operation.

Without the prior written approval of the other Party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, no Party will issue, or permit any agent or Affiliate to issue, any press releases or otherwise make, or cause any agent or Affiliate to make, any public statements with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, except where such release or statement is deemed in good faith by the releasing Party to be required by Law or any national securities exchange, in which case the Party or Parties will use its or their, as the case may be, commercially reasonable efforts to provide a copy to the other Party prior to any release or statement.8.5    Further Assurances.

To the extent insurance proceeds, condemnation awards or other payments are not committed, used or applied by Seller prior to the Closing Date to repair, restore or replace such destroyed, damaged or taken Assets, Seller shall at the Closing (a) assign to Buyer Seller’s right to receive all insurance or condemnation proceeds, awards or payments owed to Seller by reason of such destruction or taking, less any reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Seller in collecting same or in connection with such proceedings or the threat thereof, and (b) pay to Buyer all insurance or condemnation proceeds, awards or payments theretofore paid to Seller by reason of such destruction, damage or taking, less any reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Seller in collecting same or in connection with such proceedings or the threat thereof.

In the event (i) any condemnation action results in a condemnation payment in an amount less than the allocated value of the affected Asset, or (ii) any casualty event or condemnation action results in the loss or destruction of personal property or equipment without compensation for the reasonable replacement cost thereof, then in any such event the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward at Closing in the amount of the deficiency.  8.11    Operations.

A Person which is entitled to be indemnified under Section 5.1, 13.1 or 13.2 is herein referred to as an “Indemnified Person” and the Party which is obligated to indemnify an Indemnified Person under Section 5.1, 13.1 or 13.2 is herein referred to as the “Indemnifying Party” with respect to the matter for which it is obligated to indemnify such Indemnified Person.  All claims for indemnification under Sections 5.1, 13.1 and 13.2 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:     - 30 -(a)    If a third-party claim for which an Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnity under Sections 5.1, 13.1 and/or 13.2 (an “Indemnified Claim”) is made against an Indemnified Person, and if Buyer or Seller intends to seek indemnity with respect thereto by or from an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Sections 5.1, 13.1 and/or 13.2, then the Party electing to seek indemnity on behalf of such Indemnified Person shall promptly transmit to the Indemnifying Party a written notice (“Claim Notice”) (i) notifying such Indemnifying Party of such Indemnified Claim and requesting indemnity on behalf of such Indemnified Person with respect to such Indemnified Claim under Sections 5.1, 13.1 and/or 13.2, as the case may be, (ii) setting forth the full name, address for all notices and the authorized representatives of such Indemnified Person with respect to such Indemnified Claim, and (iii) describing in reasonable detail the nature of the Indemnified Claim, including a copy of all papers served with respect to such Indemnified Claim (if any) and the basis of such request for indemnification under Sections 5.1, 13.1 and/or 13.2, as the case may be.  Failure to provide such Claim Notice promptly shall not affect the right of the Indemnified Person to indemnification hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby; provided that, the Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to defend, indemnify or otherwise hold harmless an Indemnified Person with respect to a third-party claim until a Claim Notice meeting the foregoing requirements is furnished to the Indemnifying Party by the Party seeking indemnity hereunder.  Within thirty (30) days after receipt of any Claim Notice (the “Election Period”) from a Party, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Party who sent the Claim Notice (A) whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its potential liability to indemnify the Indemnified Person under Sections 5.1, 13.1 and/or 13.2, as the case may be, with respect to such third-party claim and (B) whether the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the Indemnified Person against such third-party claim; provided that, if the Indemnifying Party fails to so notify the Party who sent the Claim Notice during the Election Period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have elected to dispute such liability and not to defend against such third-party claim.(b)    If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Party who sent the Claim Notice within the Election Period that the Indemnifying Party (i) does not dispute its liability to indemnify the Indemnified Person under Sections 5.1, 13.1 and/or 13.2, as the case may be, and (ii) elects to assume the defense of such Indemnified Person with respect to such third-party claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend, at its sole cost and expense, such third-party claim by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by the Indemnifying Party to a final conclusion or settled at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party in accordance with this Section 13.3(b).  The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof; provided that, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement agreement (or settle or compromise any such third-party claim in a manner) which provides for or results in any payment by or liability of the Indemnified Person of or for any damages or other amount, any lien, charge or encumbrance on any property of the Indemnified Person, any finding of responsibility or liability on the part of the Indemnified Person or any sanction or restriction upon the conduct of any business by the Indemnified Person without the Indemnified Person’s express written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  The Indemnified Person is hereby authorized, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party (but only if the Indemnified Person is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder), to file, during the Election Period, any motion, answer or other pleadings which the Indemnified Person shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the      - 31 -Indemnifying Party and not reasonably expected to be prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.  If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Person agrees, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any such third-party claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, including the making of any related counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person (other than a Buyer Indemnified Person, if the Indemnified Person is a Buyer Indemnified Person, or a Seller Indemnified Person, if the Indemnified Person is a Seller Indemnified Person).  The Indemnified Person may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any third-party claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 13.3(b), and the Indemnified Person shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such participation.  The prosecution of the defense of a third-party claim with reasonable diligence shall include the taking of such action (including the posting of a bond, deposit or other security) as may be necessary to prevent any action to foreclose a lien against or attachment of the property of the Indemnified Person for payment of such third-party claim.(c)    If the Indemnifying Party (i) fails to notify the Party who sent the Claim Notice within the Election Period that the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Person pursuant to Section 13.3(b) or (ii) elects to defend the Indemnified Person pursuant to Section 13.3(b) but fails to prosecute the defense of (or to settle) the third-party claim with reasonable diligence, then the Indemnified Person shall have the right to defend, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party (but only if the Indemnified Person is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder), the third-party claim by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be promptly and vigorously prosecuted by the Indemnified Person to a final conclusion or settled.
