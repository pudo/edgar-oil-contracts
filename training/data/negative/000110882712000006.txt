(a)    For purposes of allocating production (and accounts receivable with respect thereto) under Section 2.4, (i) liquid Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be “from or attributable to” the Leases, the Units and the Wells when they pass through the inlet flange of the pipeline connecting into the storage facilities into which they are run or, if there are no such storage facilities, when they pass through the LACT meters or similar meters at the initial point of entry into the pipelines through which they are transported from the field and (ii) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be “from or attributable to” the Leases, the Units and the Wells when they pass through the delivery point sales meters on the pipelines through which they are transported.  Seller shall utilize reasonable interpolative procedures to arrive at an allocation of production when exact meter readings or gauging and strapping data is not available.  Seller shall provide to Purchaser evidence of all meter readings and all gauging and strapping procedures conducted on or about the Effective Time in connection with the Assets, together with all data necessary to support any estimated allocation, for purposes of establishing the adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.3.  The terms “earned” and “incurred” shall be interpreted in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and Council of Petroleum Accountants Society (“COPAS”) standards, and expenditures that are incurred pursuant to an operating agreement, unit agreement or similar agreement shall be deemed incurred when expended by the operator of the applicable Lease, Unit or Well, in accordance with Seller’s current practice.  (b)    After Closing, Purchaser shall handle all joint interest audits and other audits of Property Costs covering the period for which Seller is in whole or in part responsible under Section 2.4, provided that Purchaser shall not agree to any adjustments to previously assessed costs for which Seller is liable, or any compromise of any audit claims to which Seller would be entitled, without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  Any expenses from such audit shall be borne by Purchaser and Seller, respectively, in the same proportion as the Property Costs at issue are or would be borne by Purchaser and Seller.  Purchaser shall provide Seller with a copy of all applicable audit reports and written audit agreements received by Purchaser or its Affiliates and relating to periods for which Seller is wholly or partially responsible.ARTICLE 3     PURCHASE PRICESection 3.1    Purchase Price.  The purchase price for the Assets shall be six hundred forty million two hundred eighty-five thousand one hundred seventy-nine Dollars ($640,285,179)(the “Unadjusted Purchase Price”), as adjusted and paid, as applicable, pursuant to and in accordance with Section 3.3, Section 9.3 and Section 9.4.  Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Purchaser has delivered or caused to be delivered to an account (the “Escrow Account”) with JPMorgan Chase (the “Escrow Agent”), a wire transfer in the amount equal to (10%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price (the “Deposit”) to be held, invested, and disbursed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and an escrow agreement of even date herewith among Seller, Purchaser, and Escrow Agent (the “Escrow Agreement”).  The balance in the Escrow Account shall be distributed to Seller in accordance with Section 9.3(a) if the Closing occurs or shall be otherwise distributed in accordance with the terms of Section 10.3.Section 3.2    Allocation of Purchase Price.  The Parties recognize that this transaction is a sale of the Assets to Purchaser subject to the requirements of Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and, therefore, that an IRS Form 8594, Asset Acquisition Statement, will be required to be filed by the Parties.  The Parties agree that the Unadjusted Purchase Price and any liabilities associated with the Assets (to the extent properly taken into account as consideration under the Code) shall be allocated among the Assets for Tax purposes as set forth on Schedule 3.2 (the “Purchase Price Allocation Schedule”).  Such allocation shall be determined in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and is intended by the Parties to be consistent with the Allocated Values as determined pursuant to Section 3.4.  Within twenty (20) days following the final determination of the Adjusted Purchase Price, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller for its review and reasonable comment, a revised Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, adjusted to reflect the Adjusted Purchase Price.  The Purchase Price Allocation Schedule shall be revised to take into account subsequent adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price or the Adjusted Purchase Price and any indemnification payments in the manner provided by applicable Law.  If the Parties are unable to agree on any revisions to the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, any dispute arising in connection with the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule shall be resolved pursuant to procedures comparable to the procedures applicable under Section 9.4(b).  The Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule (as adjusted pursuant to this Section 3.2) in reporting this transaction to the applicable Taxing authorities, including on IRS Form 8594 and any other information or Tax Returns and supplements thereto required to be filed under Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.  Neither Party shall, or shall permit their Affiliates to, file any Tax Return or otherwise take any position for Tax purposes that is inconsistent with the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule (as adjusted pursuant to this Section 3.2); provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent either Party from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Taxing authority based upon or arising out of the allocation (which may result in a change to the allocation), and neither Party shall be required to litigate any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Taxing authority challenging such allocation. Section 3.3    Adjustments to Purchase Price.  All adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be made (x) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and, to the extent not inconsistent with this Agreement, in accordance with GAAP as applied by Seller in its accounting of and for the Assets (as of the Effective Time), (y) without duplication (in this Agreement or otherwise) and (z) only with respect to matters (A) in the case of Section 3.3(a)(vi) and Section 3.3(b)(v), for which notice is given on or before the Title Claim Date, and (B) in all of the other cases set forth in Section 3.3(a) and Section 3.3(b), identified on or before the 180th day after Closing (the “Cut-off Date”).  Each adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price described in Section 3.3(a) and Section 3.3(b) shall be allocated among the Assets in accordance with Section 3.4. Without limiting the foregoing, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows, with the resulting adjustments to such Unadjusted Purchase Price herein the “Adjusted Purchase Price”:(h)    The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward by the following amounts (without duplication): (i)    an amount equal to all Property Costs and other costs attributable to the ownership and operation of the Assets that are incurred at and after the Effective Time but paid by Seller (as is consistent with Section 2.4(b) and Section 2.4(c)), but excluding any amounts previously reimbursed to Seller pursuant to Section 2.4(e);  (ii)    an amount equal to, to the extent that such amounts have been received by Purchaser and not remitted or paid to Seller, (A) all proceeds from the production of Hydrocarbons from or attributable to the Leases, the Units and the Wells prior to the Effective Time, (B) all other income, proceeds, receipts and credits earned with respect to the Assets prior to the Effective Time and (C) any other amounts to which Seller is entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(c);(iii)    the amount of all prepaid expenses (including pre-paid bonuses, rentals, location building expenses, cash calls and advances to Third Party operators for expenses not yet incurred; prepaid production Taxes, severance Taxes and other similar Taxes; and scheduled payments) paid by Seller with respect to the ownership or operation of the Assets at or after the Effective Time;(iv)    to the extent that proceeds for such volumes have not been received by Seller, an amount equal to the aggregated volumes of Hydrocarbons stored in stock tanks, pipelines or other storage as of the Effective Time that are attributable to the ownership and operation of the Assets multiplied by the contract price therefor on the Effective Time;(v)    to the extent that Seller is underproduced or overdelivered as of the Effective Time as shown with respect to the any net Imbalances for any product set forth in Schedule 5.15, as complete and final settlement of all such Imbalances for each such product, the value of such Imbalances (calculated on the basis of the average price of production of the applicable product for the 30 day period prior to the delivery of the preliminary settlement statement referred to in Section 9.4(a));(vi)    any undisputed amounts for Title Benefits determined pursuant to Section 4.3;  (vii)    an amount equal to the Seller Overhead Services Amount; and (viii)    any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise agreed upon in writing by the Parties as an upward adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price.  (i)    The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by the following amounts (without duplication):(i)    an amount equal to all Property Costs and other costs attributable to the ownership and operation of the Assets that are incurred prior to the Effective Time but paid by Purchaser (as is consistent with Section 2.4(b) and Section 2.4(c)), but excluding any amounts previously reimbursed to Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.4(e);  (ii)    an amount equal to, to the extent that such amounts have been received by Seller and not remitted or paid to Purchaser, (A) all proceeds from the production of Hydrocarbons from or attributable to the Leases, the Units and the Wells at and after the Effective Time, (B) all other income, proceeds, receipts and credits earned with respect to the Assets at and after the Effective Time (excluding, all overhead fees and similar payments received from Third Parties with respect to any Assets operated by Seller prior to the Closing) and (C) any other amounts to which Purchaser is entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(b);(iii)    to the extent that Seller is overproduced or underdelivered as of the Effective Time as shown with respect to the any net Imbalances for any product set forth in Schedule 5.15, as complete and final settlement of all such Imbalances for each such product, the value of such Imbalances (calculated on the basis of the average price of production of the applicable product for the 30 day period prior to the delivery of the preliminary settlement statement referred to in Section 9.4(a));(iv)    to the extent not transferred to Purchaser at the Closing, all funds held in suspense by Seller with respect to the operation, ownership, production and developments, including those amounts set forth on Schedule 5.20; (v)    any undisputed amounts for Title Defects determined pursuant to Section 4.2 (which shall include, for purposes of certainty, an amount equal to the Allocated Value of any Assets excluded from this transaction pursuant to Section 4.2(c)) and any amounts excluded pursuant to Section 4.2(e);  (vi)    an amount equal to the Allocated Value of any Assets excluded from this transaction pursuant to Section 4.6;(vii)    an amount equal to the Allocated Value of any Assets excluded from this transaction pursuant to Section 4.7(a); and(viii)    any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise agreed upon in writing by the Parties as a downward adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price.Section 3.4    Allocated Values.  The “Allocated Values” for the Assets (which are provided for, and allocated amongst, each of the Units) are set forth on Schedule 3.4.  The share of each adjustment allocated to a particular Asset shall be allocated to the particular Asset to which such adjustment relates to the extent such adjustment relates to such Asset and to the extent that it is, in the commercially reasonable discretion of Seller, possible to do so.  Any adjustment not allocated to a specific Asset pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be allocated among the various Assets on a pro-rata basis in proportion to the Unadjusted Purchase Price allocated to such Asset on Schedule 3.4.  Seller has accepted such Allocated Values for purposes of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, but makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of such values.ARTICLE 4     TITLE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSSection 4.1    Seller’s Title.  Except for the special warranty of title set forth in the Assignments, Seller makes no warranty or representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to Seller’s title to any of the Assets, and Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that, subject to Section 4.5, Purchaser’s sole remedy for any defect of title, including any Title Defect, with respect to any of the Assets, (a) on or before the applicable Title Claim Date, shall be as set forth in Section 4.2 and, (b) subject to the following sentence, from and after the applicable Title Claim Date (without duplication), shall be pursuant to the special warranty of title set forth in the Assignments.  Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser shall not be entitled to protection under (or the right to make a claim against) the special warranty of title provided in the Assignments for any Title Defect reported under this Article 4. Section 4.2    Title Defects.  (j)    To assert a claim of a Title Defect, Purchaser must deliver a claim notice to Seller (a “Title Defect Notice”) promptly after the discovery thereof, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the Execution Date (such cut-off date, the “Title Claim Date”).  To be effective, each Title Defect Notice shall be in writing and include (i) a description of the alleged Title Defect that is reasonably sufficient for Seller to determine the basis of the alleged Title Defect, (ii) if the Title Defect is an Environmental Defect, the Asset(s) adversely affected by such Title Defect and if the Title Defect is anything other than an Environmental Defect, the Unit adversely affected by such Title Defect (in each case, a “Title Defect Property”), (iii) the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property, (iv) all documents upon which Purchaser relies for its assertion of a Title Defect, including, at a minimum, supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by Seller) to verify the existence of the alleged Title Defect and (v) the amount by which Purchaser reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property is reduced by the alleged Title Defect and the computations and information upon which Purchaser’s belief is based, including any analysis by any title attorney or examiner  hired by Purchaser (or, in the case of an Environmental Defect, any environmental remediation analysis prepared by or for Purchaser).(k)    Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure or remove on or before 120 days after the Title Claim Date (the “Cure Period”) any Title Defects (other than Environmental Defects for which this Section 4.2(b) shall not apply) for which Seller has received a Title Defect Notice from Purchaser prior to the Title Claim Date, and Purchaser shall take all actions reasonably requested by Seller to assist it with the cure or removal of any such Title Defects.  No reduction shall be made to the Closing Payment with respect to any Title Defect for which Seller has provided notice to Purchaser prior to or on the Closing Date that Seller intends to attempt to cure the Title Defect during the Cure Period (a “Remedy Notice”) or for which Seller disputes the existence (a “Disputed Defect”).  If any Title Defect with respect to which Seller provided a Remedy Notice to Purchaser is not cured by Seller within the Cure Period, Seller shall make an election with respect to such Title Defect pursuant to Section 4.2(c) no later than 130 days after the Title Claim Date (the “Remedy Deadline”); provided, however, that any downward adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price made pursuant to Section 4.2(c) shall occur at the times set forth in Section 9.4; and provided, further, that if, prior to the Remedy Deadline, the Parties cannot agree on (i) the proper and adequate cure for any such Title Defect, (ii) the Title Defect Amount or (iii) whether the alleged Title Defect constitutes a Title Defect, such dispute(s) shall be finally and exclusively resolved in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.4.  An election by Seller to attempt to cure a Title Defect shall be without prejudice to its rights under Section 4.4 and shall not constitute an admission against interest or a waiver of Seller’s right to dispute the existence, nature or value of, or cost to cure, the alleged Title Defect.  Any Disputed Defects that have not been cured, waived or otherwise resolved by the Parties prior to the Remedy Deadline shall be exclusively and finally resolved in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.4.(l)    Subject to Section 4.2(e) regarding certain Environmental Defects, in the event that any Title Defect is not waived by Purchaser or, subject to Section 4.2(b), not cured prior to the expiration of the Cure Period or Environmental Cure Period, as applicable, Seller shall, subject to the Individual Defect Threshold and the Aggregate Defect Deductible, elect to:(i)      make a downward adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price equal to an amount determined (the “Title Defect Amount”) pursuant to Section 4.2(d) as being the value of such Title Defect; or(ii)     (A) subject to the consent of Purchaser, in the case of a Title Defect that is not an Environmental Defect, exclude or have Purchaser reconvey, as applicable, the Title Defect Property that is adversely affected by such Title Defect; (B) subject to the consent of Purchaser, in the case of an Environmental Defect for which the asserted Title Defect Amount is less than the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, exclude the applicable Title Defect Property from the Assets; or (C) in the case of a Title Defect that is an Environmental Defect for which the asserted Title Defect Amount is equal to or greater than the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property, in Seller’s sole discretion, exclude the Title Defect Property from the Assets; in any of which events the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward, by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property and such Title Defect Property shall no longer be included within the definition of Assets for any purpose under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.2(c), no reduction shall be made in the Unadjusted Purchase Price with respect to any Title Defect for which the Parties agree to execute and deliver to one another a written indemnity agreement, under which Seller agrees to fully, unconditionally and irrevocably indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser from any and all Damages arising out of or resulting from such Title Defect.  Upon the election of the remedy of a Title Defect pursuant to this Section 4.2(c), the Parties shall complete any further reconveyancing (or conveyancing in the case of an Environmental Defect Hold-Back Property) of the relevant Title Defect Property as is necessary to effect such remedy.  In the case of any such reconveyancing, Purchaser shall assign the relevant Title Defect Property to Seller with a special warranty of title, subject to the Permitted Encumbrances, by, through and under Purchaser.  Any post-Closing conveyance of an Environmental Defect Hold-Back Property shall be effected by the execution of an Assignment in the form set forth on Exhibit B, and such Environmental Defect Hold-Back Property shall, from and after the date of such conveyance, be deemed to be an Asset for all purposes of this Agreement.  Any downward adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall be made (and accounted for) at the times set forth in Section 9.4.(m)    The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title Defect shall be the amount by which the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property adversely affected by such Title Defect is reduced as a result of the existence of such Title Defect and shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology, terms and conditions:(i)    if Purchaser and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;(ii)    if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge that is undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from Seller's interest in the affected Title Defect Property;(iii)    if the Title Defect reflects a discrepancy (with a proportional decrease in the working interest for the affected Title Defect Property) between (A) the Net Revenue Interest for the affected Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest stated in Schedule 3.4 then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the Net Revenue Interest decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated in Schedule 3.4; (iv)    if the Title Defect is an Environmental Defect, the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount of the estimated costs and expenses to correct or remediate the Environmental Defect (as of the Closing Date) in such a manner that is consistent with applicable Environmental Laws;(v)    if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or charge upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described in subsections (ii), (iii) or (iv) above, the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect Property adversely affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Purchaser and Seller and such other factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation; provided, however, that, the foregoing considerations notwithstanding, in the event that the Title Defect is reasonably susceptible of being cured, the Title Defect Amount shall not be greater than the reasonable cost and expense of curing or remediating, as applicable, such Title Defect; (vi)    the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect shall be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in any other Title Defect Amount hereunder, or for which Purchaser otherwise receives credit in the calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price; and(vii)    notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 4, the aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title Defects (other than Environmental Defects) upon any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property.(n)    (i)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.2: (A)with respect to alleged Environmental Defects (for which the asserted Title Defect Amount is in excess of the Individual Defect Threshold) for which Purchaser and Seller have not, prior to the Closing, agreed to a Title Defect Amount (in accordance with Section 4.2(d)(iv)) or for which, prior to Closing, the Title Defect Amount has not been determined pursuant to Section 4.4;(B)in the event the Parties have not, prior to Closing, agreed that an alleged Environmental Defect constitutes a Title Defect;(C)with respect to alleged Environmental Defects for which the asserted Title Defect Amount is less than the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property and the Parties have made an election to exclude pursuant to Section 4.2(c); (D)with respect to an alleged Environmental Defect for which the asserted Title Defect Amount is equal to or greater than the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property and Seller has made an election to exclude pursuant to Section 4.2(c); or (E)with respect to any alleged Environmental Defect for which Seller has provided notice to Purchaser prior to or on the Closing Date that Seller intends to cure or remove the Environmental Defect on or before 180 days after the Title Claim Date (the “Environmental Cure Period”),the affected Title Defect Property that is subject to such alleged Environmental Defect (an “Environmental Defect Hold-Back Property”) shall (X) not be included in the Assets at Closing, and (Y) the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect Hold-Back Property (and, if not already reflected in the preliminary settlement statement prepared prior to Closing pursuant to Section 9.4(a), the Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect Hold-Back Property shall be excluded from the Closing Payment payable at Closing).  (i)    During the Environmental Cure Period, Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, at its sole cost, to cure or remove the Environmental Defect affecting any Environmental Defect Hold-Back Property, in which case Seller shall release and indemnify Purchaser Group in accordance with Section 7.1, applied mutatis mutandis if Seller or Seller’s Representatives access Purchaser’s property in its attempt to cure or remove the Environmental Defect affecting an Environmental Defect Hold-Back Property.  Any Environmental Defect Hold-Back Property for which the Environmental Defect is cured or removed during the Environmental Cure Period shall promptly thereafter be conveyed from Seller to Purchaser, provided that if the Parties cannot agree on the proper and adequate cure for an Environmental Defect or that an Environmental Defect has been cure or removed, such dispute shall be finally and exclusively resolved in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.4.  (ii)    If an Environmental Defect affecting any Environmental Defect Hold-Back Property is not cured or removed by Seller within the Environmental Cure Period, then the Parties or Seller, as applicable, shall determine the remedy with respect to such Environmental Defect pursuant to Section 4.2(c) no later than 10 days after the end of the Environmental Cure Period;(iii)    If any conveyance of an Environmental Defect Hold-Back Property is completed prior to the Final Settlement Statement Date, then the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such conveyed Environmental Defect Hold-Back Property and further adjusted as applicable for the adjustments set forth in Section 3.3 that relate to such Environmental Defect Hold-Back Property.  If any conveyance of an Environmental Defect Hold-Back Property is completed after the Final Settlement Statement Date, then Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such conveyed Environmental Defect Hold-Back Property, adjusted as applicable for the adjustments set forth in Section 3.3 that relate to such Environmental Defect Hold-Back Property.  (f)    It is understood and agreed that Environmental Defects shall constitute Title Defects for purposes of this Agreement (as is provided in the definition of “Title Defects” set forth in Appendix A) and, as such, will be handled in accordance with, and in all instances will be subject to, the provisions of this Section 4.2 (other than Section 4.2(b) and Section 4.2(d)(vii) which shall not apply to Environmental Defects) and the other applicable provisions of this Article 4 (including the thresholds and deductibles set forth in Section 4.5).  For the avoidance of doubt, the Aggregate Defect Deductible is a single amount which includes both Title Defects and Environmental Defects.  Without limiting the disclaimers and acknowledgements set forth in Article 5 and Article 6, respectively, PURCHASER HEREBY WAIVES AND RELEASES ANY REMEDIES OR CLAIMS (WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY) THAT IT MAY HAVE AGAINST SELLER, ITS AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE SELLER GROUP UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECTS, EXCEPT SOLELY FOR THOSE REMEDIES SET FORTH IN THIS ARTICLE 4 AND SECTION 11.2(B)(IV).Section 4.3    Title Benefits.  (c)    Seller has the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to Purchaser on or before the Title Claim Date with respect to each Title Benefit discovered by Seller a notice (a “Title Benefit Notice”) in writing and including (i) a description of the Title Benefit reasonably sufficient to determine the basis of the alleged Title Benefit, (ii) the Unit affected by such Title Benefit (a “Title Benefit Property”), (iii) the Allocated Value of each Title Benefit Property, (iv) all documents upon which Seller relies for its assertion of a Title Benefit, including, at a minimum, supporting documents reasonably necessary for Purchaser (as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by Purchaser) to verify the existence of the alleged Title Benefit and (v) the amount by which Seller reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title Benefit Property is increased by such Title Benefit and the computations and information upon which Seller’s belief is based on or before the Title Claim Date with respect to each Title Benefit discovered by Seller.  (d)    Subject to the Individual Benefit Threshold and the Aggregate Benefit Deductible, with respect to each Title Benefit Property affected by Title Benefits reported under Section 4.3(a), the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount (the “Title Benefit Amount”) equal to the increase in the Allocated Value for such Title Benefit Property, as determined pursuant to Section 4.3(c).  Any upward adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 4.3 shall be made (and accounted for) at the times set forth in Section 9.4.  (e)    The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a Title Benefit shall be the amount by which the Allocated Value of the Title Benefit Property affected by such Title Benefit is increased as a result of the existence of such Title Benefit and shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology, terms and conditions:(i)    if Purchaser and Seller agree on the Title Benefit Amount, that amount shall be the Title Benefit Amount; (ii)    if the Title Benefit reflects a difference (with a proportional increase in the working interest for the affected Title Defect Property) between (A) the Net Revenue Interest for the affected Title Benefit Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest stated in Schedule 3.4, then the Title Benefit Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Benefit Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the Net Revenue Interest increase and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated in Schedule 3.4; and(iii)    if the Title Benefit represents a benefit in the ownership or title to the Title Benefit Property of a type not described in subsections (i) or (ii) above, the Title Benefit Amount shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Title Benefit Property, the portion of the Title Benefit Property benefitted by the Title Benefit, the legal effect of the Title Benefit, the potential economic effect of the Title Benefit over the life of the Title Benefit Property, the values placed upon the Title Benefit by Purchaser and Seller and such other factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation. (f)    If the Parties cannot reach an agreement on alleged Title Benefits and Title Benefit Amounts by the scheduled Closing, the provisions of Section 4.4 shall apply. Section 4.4    Title Disputes.  The Parties shall attempt to agree on all Title Defects and Title Benefits and Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts, respectively, prior to Closing.  If the Parties are unable to agree on Title Defects and Title Benefits and Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts, respectively, by the scheduled Closing, then Seller’s good faith estimate shall be used to determine the Closing Payment pursuant to Section 9.4.  If, after the Remedy Deadline, the Parties are unable to agree on an alleged Title Defect or Title Benefit or Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount (the “Disputed Title Matters”) such dispute(s), and only such dispute(s), shall be exclusively and finally resolved in accordance with the following provisions of this Section 4.4.  Purchaser shall provide to Seller by not later than the tenth (10th) Business Day following the Remedy Deadline a written description meeting the requirements of Section 4.2(a) or Section 4.3(a), as applicable, together with all supporting documentation, of the Disputed Title Matters.  By not later than ten (10) Business Days after Seller’s receipt of Purchaser’s written description of the Disputed Title Matters, Seller shall provide to Purchaser a written response setting forth Seller’s position with respect to the Disputed Title Matters together with all supporting documentation.(a)    By not later than ten (10) Business Days after Purchaser’s receipt of Seller’s written response to Purchaser’s written description of the Disputed Title Matters, Purchaser may initiate a non-administered arbitration of any such dispute(s) conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent that such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section, by written notice (the “Title Arbitration Notice”) to Seller of any Disputed Title Matters not otherwise resolved or waived that are to be resolved by arbitration (“Final Disputed Title Matters”).(b)    The arbitration shall be held before a one member arbitration panel (the “Title Arbitrator”), determined as follows.  The Title Arbitrator shall be an attorney with at least ten (10) years’ experience (i) in the case of Title Defects other than Environmental Defects, examining oil and gas titles in the State of North Dakota and (ii) in the case of Environmental Defects, as an environmental attorney practicing in the State of North Dakota.  Within two (2) Business Days following Seller’s receipt of the Title Arbitration Notice, Seller and Purchaser shall each exchange lists of three (3) acceptable, qualified arbitrators.  Within two (2) Business Days following the exchange of lists of acceptable arbitrators, the Parties shall select by mutual agreement the Title Arbitrator from their original lists of three (3) acceptable arbitrators.  If no such agreement is reached within seven (7) Business Days following the delivery of Title Arbitration Notice, the Houston, Texas office of the American Arbitration Association shall select an arbitrator from the original lists provided by the Parties to serve as the Title Arbitrator.(c)    Within three (3) Business Days following the selection of the Title Arbitrator, the Parties shall submit one copy to the Title Arbitrator of (i) this Agreement, with specific reference to this Section 4.4 and the other applicable provisions of this Article 4, (ii) Purchaser’s written description of the Final Disputed Title Matters, together with the supporting documents that were provided to Seller, (iii) Seller’s written response to Purchaser’s written description of the Final Disputed Title Matters, together with the supporting documents that were provided to Purchaser and (iv) the Title Arbitration Notice.  The Title Arbitrator shall resolve the Final Disputed Title Matters based only on the foregoing submissions, and shall select either the position of Seller or Purchaser with respect to each Final Disputed Title Matter.  Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall have the right to submit additional documentation to the Title Arbitrator nor to demand discovery on the other Party.  (d)    The Title Arbitrator shall make its determination by written decision within thirty (30) days following Seller’s receipt of the Title Arbitration Notice (the “Arbitration Decision”).  The Arbitration Decision shall be final and binding upon the Parties, without right of appeal.  In making its determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the provisions of this Article 4.  The Title Arbitrator may consult with and engage disinterested Third Parties to advise the Title Arbitrator, but shall disclose to the Parties the identities of such consultants and shall only use such Third Parties to the extent necessary to resolve the Final Disputed Title Matters.  Any such consultant shall not have worked as an employee or consultant for either Party or its Affiliates during the five (5) year period preceding the arbitration nor have any financial interest in the dispute.(e)    The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Title Defects and Title Defect Amounts or Title Benefits and Title Benefit Amounts and shall not be empowered to award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter.(f)    Each Party shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of preparing and presenting its case.  Seller shall bear one-half and Purchaser shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator, including any costs incurred by the Title Arbitrator that are attributable to the consultation of any Third Party.(g)    The Parties shall implement the Arbitration Decision as follows: (i) in the case of alleged Title Defects determined to be Title Defects, such Title Defects shall be remedied pursuant to Section 4.2(c) within ten (10) Business Days following Seller’s receipt of the Arbitration Decision (with any amounts owed, as a result of such remedy, to be made and accounted for at the times set forth in Section 9.4(b)), and (ii) in the case of disputed Title Benefits, Title Benefit Amounts or Title Defect Amounts, any amounts determined to be owed by either Party shall be accounted for in the determination of the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 9.4(b).  Any alleged Title Defects or Title Benefits determined not to be Title Defects or Title Benefits under the Arbitration Decision shall be final and binding as not being Title Defects or Title Benefits.  The Parties shall complete any reconveyancing of property as is necessary to effect the remedy determined pursuant to subsection (i) above.  In the case of any such reconveyancing, Purchaser shall assign the relevant Lease or Well to Seller with a special warranty of title, subject to no burdens, liens or encumbrances other than the Permitted Encumbrances, by, through and under Purchaser.(h)    Any dispute over the interpretation or application of this Section 4.4 shall be decided by the Title Arbitrator with reference to the Laws of the State of Texas.  Section 4.5    Limitations on Applicability.  (a)    The right of Purchaser or Seller to assert a Title Defect or Title Benefit, respectively, under this Article 4 shall terminate on the Title Claim Date, except that until the alleged Title Defect or Title Benefit or Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount, as applicable, is resolved in accordance with this Agreement, there shall be no termination of Purchaser’s or Seller’s rights under this Article 4 with respect to any alleged Title Defect or Title Benefit or Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount properly reported in accordance with Section 4.4 on or before the Title Claim Date.  Thereafter, Purchaser’s and Seller’s sole and exclusive rights and remedies with regard to title to the Assets shall be as set forth in the respective Assignments.  Without limiting the foregoing, if a Title Defect under this Article 4 results from any matter that could also result in the breach of any representation or warranty of Seller as set forth in Article 5 or a breach of Seller’s special warranty of title in the Assignments, and Purchaser has knowledge of such matter prior to the Title Claim Date, Purchaser shall only be entitled to assert such matter as a Title Defect to the extent permitted by Article 4; and, for the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall be precluded from also asserting any such matter as the basis of the breach of any such representation or warranty or as a claim against Seller’s special warranty of title provided in the Assignments. (b)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price or other remedies available in respect of Title Defects (including Title Defects constituting Environmental Defects) or Title Benefits, as applicable, under this Article 4: (i)    With respect to Title Defects, (A) for any Title Defect Amount with respect to an individual Title Defect Property if such amount does not exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) (the “Individual Defect Threshold”), provided that, Purchaser shall be entitled to recover the full Title Defect Amount once the Individual Defect Threshold is met, subject to the Aggregate Defect Deductible; and (B) unless the amount of all such Title Defect Amounts (provided that each such Title Defect Amount exceeds the Individual Defect Threshold), in the aggregate (excluding any Title Defect Amounts with respect to Title Defects cured or indemnified by Seller in accordance with this Article 4) exceeds two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price (the “Aggregate Defect Deductible”), after which point, subject to the Individual Defect Threshold, Purchaser shall be entitled to adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price or other remedies elected by Seller in accordance with Section 4.2(c) only with respect to Title Defect Amounts in excess of such Aggregate Defect Deductible and only to the extent that Title Defect Amounts exceed the Aggregate Defect Deductible.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Title Defects which would otherwise constitute breaches of the special warranty of title set forth in the Assignments but which are asserted prior to the Title Claim Date shall not be subject to the Individual Defect Threshold or the Aggregate Defect Deductible.(ii)    With respect to Title Benefits, (A) for any Title Benefit Amount with respect to an individual Title Benefit Property: if such amount does not exceed  One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) (the “Individual Benefit Threshold”), provided that, Seller shall be entitled to recover the full Title Benefit Amount once the Individual Benefit Threshold is met, subject to the Aggregate Benefit Deductible; and (B) unless the amount of all such Title Benefit Amounts (provided that each such Title Benefit Amount exceeds the Individual Benefit Threshold), in the aggregate exceeds two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price (the “Aggregate Benefit Deductible”), after which point, subject to the Individual Benefit Threshold, Seller shall be entitled to adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price only with respect to Title Benefit Amounts in excess of such Aggregate Benefit Deductible and only to the extent that Title Benefit Amounts exceed the Aggregate Benefit Deductible.(c)    Without prejudice to any of the other dates by which performance or the exercise of rights is due hereunder, or the Parties’ rights or obligations in respect thereof, the Parties hereby acknowledge that, as set forth more fully in Section 13.14, time is of the essence in performing their obligations and exercising their rights under this Article 4, and, as such, that each and every date and time by which such performance or exercise is due shall be the firm and final date and time.Section 4.6    Consents to Assignment and Preferential Rights to Purchase.  (a)    Promptly after the Execution Date, Seller shall prepare and send (i) notices to the holders of any required consents to assignment (including the Specified Consent Requirements that are set forth on Schedule 5.16) requesting consents to the Assignments; (ii) notices to the holders of any applicable preferential rights to purchase or similar rights (including rights to purchase or similar rights arising in connection with change in control provisions) (collectively, “Preferential Rights”) that are set forth on Schedule 5.16 in compliance with the terms of such rights and requesting waivers of such rights; and (iii) upon Purchaser’s review and written request, notices under each Contract and for each interest described under Section 2.2(g) or Section 2.2(i) for which consent or a waiver is required from a counterparty or under applicable Law in order to transfer, assign or amend such Contract. Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause such consents and waivers of Preferential Rights (or the exercise thereof), to be obtained and delivered prior to Closing.  Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller in seeking to obtain such consents to assignment and waivers of Preferential Rights.  Any Preferential Right must be exercised subject to all terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including the successful Closing of this Agreement pursuant to Article 9 as to those Assets for which Preferential Rights have not been exercised.  The consideration payable under this Agreement for any particular Asset for purposes of Preferential Right notices shall be the Allocated Value for such Asset, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 3.3.  If, prior to the Closing Date, any Party discovers any required consents or Preferential Rights (applying to the Assets) for which notices have not been delivered pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 4.6(a), then (A) the Party making such discovery shall provide the other Party with written notification of such consents or Preferential Rights, as applicable, (B) Seller, following delivery or receipt of such written notification, will promptly send notices to the holders of such required consents requesting consents and notices to the holders of such Preferential Rights in compliance with the terms of such rights and requesting waivers of such rights and (C) the terms and conditions of this Section 4.6 shall apply to the Assets subject to such consents or Preferential Rights, as applicable.(b)    In no event shall there be included in the Assignments any Asset for which a Specified Consent Requirement has not been satisfied.  In cases in which the Asset subject to such a requirement is a Contract and Purchaser is assigned the Property or Properties to which the Contract relates, but the Contract is not transferred to Purchaser due to the unwaived Specified Consent Requirement, (i) Seller shall continue after Closing to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to satisfy the Specified Consent Requirement so that such Contract can be transferred to Purchaser upon receipt of the Specified Consent Requirement, (ii) the Contract shall be held by Seller for the benefit of Purchaser until the Specified Consent Requirement is satisfied or the Contract has terminated and (iii) Purchaser shall pay all amounts due thereunder, perform all obligations thereunder and indemnify Seller against any Damages incurred or suffered by Seller as a consequence of remaining a party to such Contract until the Specified Consent Requirement is satisfied or the Contract has terminated.  In cases in which the Asset subject to such a Specified Consent Requirement is a Property and such consent is not satisfied by Closing, the affected Property and the Assets related to that Property shall not be transferred at Closing and the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the Property and related Assets, provided that Seller shall continue after Closing to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to satisfy the Specified Consent Requirement so that such Property and the Assets related to the Property can be transferred to Purchaser upon receipt of the Specified Consent Requirement, subject to the remainder of this Section 4.6(b). If an unsatisfied Specified Consent Requirement with respect to which an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price is made under Section 3.3 is subsequently satisfied prior to the date of delivery of the final settlement statement under Section 9.4(b), a separate closing shall be held within five (5) Business Days thereof at which (i) Seller shall convey the affected Property and related Assets to Purchaser in accordance with this Agreement and (ii) Purchaser shall pay an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Property and related Assets, adjusted in accordance with Section 3.3, to Seller.  If such consent requirement is not satisfied by the date of delivery of the final settlement statement, Seller shall have no further obligation to sell and convey such Property and related Assets and Purchaser shall have no further obligation to purchase, accept and pay for such Property, and the affected Property and related Assets shall be deemed to be deleted from Exhibit A‑1, Exhibit A‑2, Schedule 3.4 and the other applicable Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement for all purposes.(c)    If any Preferential Right affecting an Asset is exercised prior to Closing, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be decreased by the Allocated Value for such Assets, and the affected Assets shall be deemed to be deleted from Exhibit A-1, Exhibit A-2, Schedule 3.4 and the other applicable Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement for all purposes.  Seller shall retain the consideration paid by the Third Party, and shall have no further obligation with respect to such affected Assets under this Agreement.  Should a Third Party fail to exercise its Preferential Right as to any portion of the Assets prior to Closing and the time for exercise or waiver has not yet expired, the affected Assets shall not be transferred at Closing and the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Values of such Assets.  In the event that such Third Party exercises its Preferential Right following the Closing, Seller shall have no further obligation to sell and convey the affected Assets and Purchaser shall have no further obligation to purchase, accept and pay for such affected Assets, and the affected Assets shall be deemed to be deleted from Exhibit A-1, Exhibit A-2, Schedule 3.4 and the other applicable Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement for all purposes.  If, on the other hand, the applicable Preferential Rights are waived or expire, a separate closing shall be held within five (5) Business Days thereof at which (i) Seller shall convey the affected Assets to Purchaser in accordance with this Agreement and (ii) Purchaser shall pay an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Assets, adjusted in accordance with Section 3.3, to Seller.  Section 4.7    Casualty or Condemnation Loss.  (a)    If, after the Execution Date, but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is damaged, destroyed or made unavailable or unusable for the intended purpose by fire or other casualty or is taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain (each a “Casualty Loss”), and the loss as a result of such individual Casualty Loss exceeds five percent (5%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price, Purchaser shall nevertheless be required to close, and Seller shall elect by written notice to Purchaser prior to Closing either (i) to cause the Assets adversely affected by any such individual Casualty Loss to be repaired or restored to at least their condition prior to such Casualty Loss, at Seller’s sole cost and expense, as promptly as reasonably practicable (which work may extend after the Closing Date), (ii) to indemnify Purchaser against any costs or expenses that Purchaser reasonably incurs to repair or restore the Assets subject to any such Casualty Loss or (iii) to exclude the affected Assets from this Agreement and reduce the Unadjusted Purchase Price by the Allocated Value of such Assets.  In each case, Seller shall retain all rights to insurance, unpaid awards, condemnation payments and other rights and claims against Third Parties with respect to the Casualty Loss, except to the extent the Parties otherwise agree in writing.(b)    If, after the Execution Date, but prior to the Closing Date, any Casualty Loss occurs, and the loss as a result of such individual Casualty Loss is five percent (5%) or less of the Unadjusted Purchased Price, Purchaser shall nevertheless be required to close and Seller shall, at Closing, pay to Purchaser all sums paid to Seller by Third Parties (including insurers) by reason of such individual Casualty Loss and, to the extent necessary, shall assign, transfer and set over to Purchaser or subrogate Purchaser to  all of Seller’s right, title and interest (if any) in unpaid awards, condemnation payments and other rights and claims against Third Parties (other than Persons within the Seller Group) arising out of the Casualty Loss.

The Parties may elect to exercise or not exercise indemnification rights under this Section 11.2(d) on behalf of the other Indemnified Persons affiliated with it in its sole discretion and shall have no liability to any such other Indemnified Person for any action or inaction under this Section 11.2(d).Section 11.3    Indemnification Actions.  All claims for indemnification under Section 11.2 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:(a)    For purposes hereof, (i) the term “Indemnifying Person” when used in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person or Persons having an obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such Damages pursuant to this Article 11 and (ii) the term “Indemnified Person” when used in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person or Persons having the right to be indemnified with respect to such Damages by another Person or Persons pursuant to this Article 11.(b)    To make a claim for indemnification under Section 11.2, an Indemnified Person shall notify the Indemnifying Person of its claim under this Section 11.3, including the specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the “Claim Notice”).  In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon a claim by a Third Party against the Indemnified Person (a “Third Person Claim”), the Indemnified Person shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Person has actual knowledge of the Third Person Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to the Third Person Claim; provided that the failure of any Indemnified Person to give notice of a Third Person Claim as provided in this Section 11.3 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations under Section 11.2 except to the extent such failure results in insufficient time being available to permit the Indemnifying Person to effectively defend against the Third Person Claim or otherwise prejudices the Indemnifying Person’s ability to defend against the Third Person Claim.  In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that was inaccurate or breached.(c)    In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Person Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Person whether it admits or denies its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person against such Third Person Claim under this Article 11.  If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the Indemnified Person within such thirty (30) day period whether the Indemnifying Person admits or denies its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person, it shall be conclusively deemed to have denied such indemnification obligation hereunder.  The Indemnified Person is authorized, prior to and during such thirty (30) day period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Person and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Person.(d)    If the Indemnifying Person admits its obligation, it shall have the right and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Third Person Claim.  The Indemnifying Person shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof.  If requested by the Indemnifying Person, the Indemnified Person agrees to cooperate in contesting any Third Person Claim that the Indemnifying Person elects to contest (provided, however, that the Indemnified Person shall not be required to bring any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person).  The Indemnified Person may at its own expense participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third Person Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Person pursuant to this Section 11.3(d).  An Indemnifying Person shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, settle any Third Person Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto which (i) does not result in a final resolution of the Indemnified Person’s liability with respect to the Third Person Claim (including, in the case of a settlement, an unconditional written release of the Indemnified Person) or (ii) may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Person (other than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity).(e)    If the Indemnifying Person does not admit its obligation or admits its obligation but fails to diligently defend or settle the Third Person Claim, then the Indemnified Person shall have the right to defend against the Third Person Claim (at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person, if the Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of the Indemnified Person’s choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Person to admit its obligation and assume the defense of the Third Person Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof.  If the Indemnifying Person has not yet admitted its obligation to provide indemnification with respect to a Third Person Claim, the Indemnified Person shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Person of any proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Person shall have the option for ten (10) days following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its obligation to provide indemnification with respect to the Third Person Claim and (ii) if its obligation is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable judgment, the proposed settlement.  If the Indemnified Person settles any Third Person Claim over the objection of the Indemnifying Person after the Indemnifying Person has timely admitted its obligation in writing and assumed the defense of a Third Person Claim, the Indemnified Person shall be deemed to have waived any right to indemnity therefor.(f)    In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Person Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Damages complained of, (ii) admit its obligation to provide indemnification with respect to such Damages or (iii) dispute the claim for such indemnification.  If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the Indemnified Person within such thirty (30) day period that it has cured the Damages or that it disputes the claim for such indemnification, the Indemnifying Person shall be deemed to have disputed such claim for indemnification.Section 11.4    Limitation on Actions.  (d)    The representations and warranties of the Parties in Article 5 and Article 6 and the covenants and agreements of the Parties in Article 7 and the corresponding representations and warranties given in the certificates delivered at Closing pursuant to Section 9.2(b) and Section 9.3(b), as applicable, shall survive the Closing for a period of twelve (12) months (unless a shorter period is expressly provided within the applicable Section), except that (i) the representations, warranties and acknowledgements, as applicable, in Section 5.2, Section 5.3, Section 5.4, Section 5.6, Section 6.2, Section 6.3, Section 6.4, and Section 6.14 shall survive indefinitely, (ii) the representations and warranties in Section 5.10, Section 5.12 and Section 5.15 and the covenants in Section 7.4 shall survive the Closing for a period of twenty-four (24) months (iii) the representations and warranties in Section 5.11 shall survive Closing until sixty (60) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including extension) for the subject Taxes and (iv) the covenants and agreements, as applicable, in Section 7.1(d), Section 7.3, Section 7.6, Section 7.7 and Section 7.10 shall survive indefinitely.  The remainder of this Agreement (including the disclaimers in Section 5.22) shall survive the Closing without time limit except (A) as may otherwise be expressly provided herein and (B) for the provisions of Article 12, which shall survive Closing until sixty (60) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including extension) for the subject Taxes.  Representations, warranties, covenants and agreements shall be of no further force and effect after the date of their expiration, provided that there shall be no termination of any bona fide claim asserted pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement prior to its expiration date. (e)    The indemnities in Section 11.2(a)(ii), Section 11.2(a)(iii), Section 11.2(b)(i) and Section 11.2(b)(ii) shall terminate as of the termination date of each respective representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is subject to indemnification thereunder, except in each case as to matters for which a specific written claim for indemnity has been delivered to the Indemnifying Person on or before such termination date.  The indemnities in Section 11.2(a)(i), Section 11.2(b)(iii), Section 11.2(b)(iv), and Section 11.2(b)(v) shall continue without time limit.(f)    Seller shall not have any liability for any indemnification under Section 11.2(b)(i) or Section 11.2(b)(ii) (other than in respect to claims relating to a breach of a representation or warranty in Section 5.10, Section 5.11, Section 5.12 or Section 5.15 or a breach of a covenant or agreement in Section 7.4 or Article 12), until and unless the aggregate amount of the liability for all Damages for which Claim Notices are delivered by Purchaser therefor exceeds two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price, and then only to the extent such Damages exceed two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price.  Purchaser shall not have any liability for any indemnification under Section 11.2(a)(ii) (other than with respect to claims relating to a breach of a covenant or agreement in Article 12) or Section 11.2(a)(iii) until and unless the aggregate amount of the liability for all Damages for which Claim Notices are delivered by Seller therefor exceeds two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price, and then only to the extent such Damages exceed two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price. (g)    Except with respect to liability for indemnification under Section 11.2(b)(i) with respect to breaches of covenants and agreements under Article 12, Section 11.2(b)(iii), Section 11.2(b)(iv), or Section 11.2(b)(v), Seller shall not be required to indemnify the Purchaser Group under this Article 11 for aggregate Damages in excess of ten percent (10%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price. (h)    The amount of any Damages for which an Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnity under this Article 11 shall be reduced by (i) the amount of insurance proceeds realized by the Indemnified Person or its Affiliates with respect to such Damages (net of any collection costs, and excluding the proceeds of any insurance policy issued or underwritten by the Indemnified Person or its Affiliates) and (ii) an amount equal to the amount of any net Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Person or its Affiliates as a result of such Damages in the year such Damages are incurred. (i)    Purchaser shall not be entitled to indemnification or any other remedy under this Agreement with respect to any Damages or other liability, loss, cost, expense, claim, award or judgment to the extent attributable to or arising out of the actions of Purchaser as operator of any of the Properties.(j)    In no event shall (i) any Indemnified Person be entitled to duplicate compensation with respect to the same Damage, liability, loss, cost, expense, claim, award or judgment under more than one provision of this Agreement and the various documents delivered in connection with the Closing, and (ii) any Person be entitled to indemnification hereunder with respect to a breach by an Indemnifying Person of any of the representations, warranties or covenants made or agreed to by such Indemnifying Person hereunder of which such Person had actual knowledge prior to the Closing Date.ARTICLE 12     TAX MATTERSSection 12.1    Tax Filings.  From the Effective Time through the Closing Date, Seller (or, if applicable, the designated operator) shall be responsible for filing with the Taxing authorities the applicable Tax Returns for all Asset Taxes relating to the Assets that are required to be filed on or before the Closing Date and paying the Taxes reflected on such Tax Returns as due and owing (provided that to the extent such Taxes relate to the periods from and after the Effective Time, as determined pursuant to Section 12.2, promptly following Seller’s request (and in accordance with Section 12.2), Purchaser shall pay to Seller any such Taxes, but only to the extent that such amounts have not already been accounted for under Section 3.3 and have actually been paid by Seller to the applicable Governmental Body or designated operator).  Purchaser (or, if applicable, the designated operator) shall be responsible for filing with the appropriate Taxing authorities the applicable Tax Returns for all Asset Taxes that are required to be filed after the Closing Date and paying the Taxes reflected on such Tax Returns as due and owing (provided that to the extent such Taxes relate to the periods before the Effective Time, as determined pursuant to Section 12.2, promptly following Purchaser’s request (and in accordance with Section 12.2), Seller shall pay to Purchaser any such Taxes, but only to the extent that such amounts have not already been accounted for under Section 3.3 and have actually been paid by Purchaser to the applicable Governmental Body or designated operator); provided, however, that in the event that Seller (or a designated operator) is required by applicable Tax Law to file a Tax Return with respect to Asset Taxes after the Closing Date that includes all or a portion of a Tax period for which Purchaser is liable for such Taxes, Seller (or the designated operator) shall file such Tax Return and shall pay the Taxes reflected on such Tax Return as due and owing, and promptly following Seller’s request (and in accordance with section 12.2), Purchaser shall pay to Seller all such Taxes allocable to the period or portion thereof beginning at or after the Effective Time, as determined pursuant to Section 12.2 (but only to the extent that such amounts have not already been accounted for under Section 3.3 and have actually been paid by Seller to the applicable Governmental Body or designated operator), but only if such Taxes arise out of the filing of an original return.  Seller shall be entitled to all Tax refunds that relate to any such Taxes allocable to any Tax period, or portion thereof, ending before the Effective Time.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary (including Section 2.4(g)), to the extent that Seller or Purchaser receives any Tax refund to which Seller or Purchaser (as the case may be) is entitled, Seller or Purchaser (as the case may be) shall immediately pay such amount to the other Party to the extent the Adjusted Purchase Price has not been increased pursuant to Section 3.3 on account thereof. Section 12.2    Current Tax Period Taxes.  Asset Taxes assessed against the Assets with respect to the Tax period in which the Effective Time occurs (the “Current Tax Period”), but excluding severance production or similar Taxes that are based on quantity of or the value of production of Hydrocarbons and sales and use Taxes, shall be apportioned between the Parties as of the Effective Time with (a) Seller being obligated to pay a proportionate share of the actual amount of such Taxes for the Current Tax Period determined by multiplying such actual Taxes by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Current Tax Period prior to the Effective Time and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the Current Tax Period and (b) Purchaser being obligated to pay a proportionate share of the actual amount of such Taxes for the Current Tax Period determined by multiplying such actual Taxes by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days (including the Closing Date) in the Current Tax Period at and after the Effective Time and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the Current Tax Period.  As described in Section 2.4(g), severance, production and similar Taxes that are based on quantity of or the value of production of Hydrocarbons shall be apportioned between the Parties based on the number of units or value of production actually produced or sold, as applicable, before, and at or after, the Effective Time. Sales and use Taxes shall be apportioned between the Parties based on transactions occurring before, and at or after, the Effective Time.  In the event that Purchaser or Seller makes any payment (directly or indirectly) for which it is entitled to reimbursement under this Article 12, the applicable Party shall make such reimbursement promptly but in no event later than ten (10) days after the presentation of a statement setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which the presenting Party is entitled along with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the amount of the reimbursement. Section 12.3    Purchase Price Adjustments.  The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be increased pursuant to Section 3.3 by (or Purchaser shall otherwise reimburse Seller for) the amount of Asset Taxes imposed on the ownership of the Assets or the production of Hydrocarbons from such Assets for all Tax periods or portions thereof ending before the Effective Time that Seller has paid on behalf of other working interest owners, royalty interest owners, overriding royalty interest owners and other interest owners in such Assets and that have not been recouped by Seller before the Closing Date from such other working interest owners, royalty interest owners, overriding royalty interest owners and other interest owners in such Assets.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary (including Section 2.4(g)), to the extent that Purchaser receives any recoupment of Taxes described in the preceding sentence, Purchaser shall immediately pay such amount to Seller to the extent the Adjusted Purchase Price has not been increased pursuant to Section 3.3 on account thereof. Section 12.4    Characterization of Certain Payments.  The Parties agree that any payments made pursuant to this Article 12, Article 11, Section 2.4 or Section 9.4 shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price unless otherwise required by Law.Section 12.5    Withholding Taxes.  All payments due to Seller under this Agreement shall be made net of any applicable deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax provided, however, that Purchaser shall provide at least ten (10) days’ notice to Seller if any such amounts will be withheld.

Any failure by either Party to comply with any of its obligations, agreements or conditions herein contained may be waived by the Party to whom such compliance is owed by an instrument signed by such Party and expressly identified as a waiver, but not in any other manner.

This Agreement contains a number of dates and times by which performance or the exercise of rights is due, and the Parties intend that each and every such date and time be the firm and final date and time, as agreed.  For this reason, each Party hereby waives and relinquishes any right it might otherwise have to challenge its failure to meet any performance or rights election date applicable to it on the basis that its late action constitutes substantial performance, to require the other Party to show prejudice, or on any equitable grounds.  Without limiting the foregoing, time is of the essence in this Agreement.  If the date specified in this Agreement for giving any notice or taking any action is not a Business Day (or if the period during which any notice is required to be given or any action taken expires on a date which is not a Business Day), then the date for giving such notice or taking such action (and the expiration date of such period during which notice is required to be given or action taken) shall be the next day that is a Business Day.Section 13.15    Delivery of Records.

Each of Seller and Purchaser agrees to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the other Party in the completion of such an Exchange including an Exchange subject to the procedures outlined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1031(k)-1 and/or IRS Revenue Procedure 2000-37, 2000-2 C.B. 308 (as modified by IRS Revenue Procedure 2004-51, 2004-2 C.B. 294).  Each of Seller and Purchaser shall have the right at any time prior to Closing to assign its rights under this Agreement to a qualified intermediary (as that term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(iii)) or an exchange accommodation titleholder (as that term is defined in IRS Revenue Procedure 2000-37, 2000-2 C.B. 308) to effect an Exchange.  In connection with any such Exchange, any exchange accommodation title holder shall have taken all steps necessary to own the relevant Assets under applicable Law.  Each of Seller and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that neither an assignment of a Party’s rights under this Agreement nor any other actions taken by a Party or any other Person in connection with the Exchange shall release either Party from, or modify, any of their respective liabilities and obligations (including indemnity obligations to each other) under this Agreement, and neither Seller nor Purchaser makes any representations as to any particular tax treatment that may be afforded to the other Party by reason of such assignment or any other actions taken in connection with the Exchange.  Any Party electing to treat the acquisition or sale of the Assets as an Exchange shall be obligated to pay all additional costs incurred hereunder as a result of the Exchange, and in consideration for the cooperation of the other Party, the Party electing Exchange treatment shall agree to pay all costs associated with the Exchange and to indemnify and hold such other Party and its Affiliates, officers, directors, partners, members, employees, and agents harmless from and against any and all liabilities and Taxes arising out of, based upon, attributable to or resulting from the Exchange or transactions or actions taken in connection with the Exchange that would not have been incurred by the other Party but for the electing Party’s Exchange election.[Signature pages follow]IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been signed by each of the Parties on the Execution Date.SELLER:  HELIS OIL & GAS COMPANY, L.L.C.By Helis Energy, L.L.C., ManagerBy:/s/ David A.
